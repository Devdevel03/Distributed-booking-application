# Distributed Booking Application

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a robust distributed booking system that offers an intuitive, efficient, and scalable solution for managing reservations across various services and locations. Leveraging modern client-server architecture and cutting-edge technologies—with Java as the core language—the application ensures real-time data synchronization, high availability, and a seamless user experience. By integrating a clean, responsive UI with powerful backend services, the system is designed to simplify the booking process, minimize wait times, and boost user satisfaction. Adhering to best practices in security, cross-platform compatibility, and enterprise-level frameworks, this distributed booking application is built to manage high traffic volumes while maintaining reliable performance in a dynamic, multi-user environment.
